  Welcome to the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign wireless information skill.
  How may I assist you? If you'd like more information on what I can do, say "help".

help: |
  I can provide information about wireless connections in various buildings here at the university. 
  I can also tell you how many total wireless access points and client devices are connected to these points. 
  To start a query, just tell me the building name. 
  For example, if want to know the wireless information for Illini Union, just say "Illini Union". 
  Then, say "start" to initiate the query. 
  Or, you can say "which buildings are busy", and I will tell you the names of busy buildings. 
  Or, you can say "which building has mostly connection", and I will tell you top 3 buildingname and how many client device.
  Finally, you can say "stop" or "goodbye" to end this session.
