  Welcome to U.I.U.C. library checker. How can I help you?

help: |
  Take Grainger Library as an example.
  Say "Grainger Library information" to know about some basic information about the library, such as consulting hours, phone number, email and address.
  Say "Grainger Library opening hours, tomorrow" to know about the opening hours of the library on whatever date.
  Say "Grainger Library next seven days" to know about the opening hours of the library next seven days, including today.
  There are more expressions that are supported to do the above. 
  Say "sample questions" if you want to listen to some other sample queries.
  Say "catalog" to see what libraries are supported.
