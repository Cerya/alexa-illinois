  Welcome to U.I.U.C. library checker. How can I help you?

  Say "your library, your date" to know about the opening hours of that library on that date.
  Say "next seven days, your library" to know about the opening hours of that library next seven days, including today.
  There are more expressions that are supported to do the above. Say "sample questions" if you want to listen to some sample queries.
  Say "catalog" to see what libraries are supported.
