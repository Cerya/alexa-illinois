  Welcome to the Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District information skill.
  For details on what I can answer, just say "help".
  How may I assist you today?

  Here are the routes in service today.
  {% for route in routes %}
    {{ route }}.
  {% endfor %}

    Walk {{ item.directional }} from {{ item.start }} to
    {{ item.end }} for {{ item.distance }} miles.
  {% endfor %}
  {% endif %}
  {% if not info.services == [] %}
  {% for service in info.services %}
      {% if not service == [] %}
      {% for item in service %}
        Take line {{ item.route }}, from {{ item.start }}, to {{ item.end }}.
      {% endfor %}
      {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
  {% endif %}
  The estimated travel time is {{ info.time }} minutes.
  If you would like to hear a different route, say "change".

help: |
  For the name of your current stop, say "stop name".
  To find out all routes that will stop at this location today, say "routes in service".
  To find out what time a specific route will stop at this location, say "when will the green route come", for example.
  You can also ask if a specific route will be running on any given day.
  To get directions to a specific stop, say "how do I get to" and then say your destination.
  What else can I assist you with?
