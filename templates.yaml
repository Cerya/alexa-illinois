welcome: Welcome to U.I.U.C. menu checker. How can I help you? Say "help" to know about how to use me, or say "interactive" to query in an interactive way. Say "vegetarian" to filter Vegetarian food only.

help: The first thing you can do with me is to check the menu, specifically entrees in dining halls. For example, here are some sample questions. You can ask "What's the dinner today in P.A.R. dining hall?", "What's the the dinner today in P.A.R tomorrow", or simply "Dinner in P.A.R hall today".Or you can say "interactive" to let me ask questions about your query. After you got your answers for the entrees, you can continue asking about other things about your query. You can try it out now.

vegetarian: Vegetarian food filter activated. Say it again if you want to turn it off. You can carry on with your query now. 

inter-ask-hall: Sure. Which dining hall's menu do you want to know?

inter-ask-meal: Ok. Which meal do you want to know, breakfast, lunch, or dinner?

inter-ask-date: Got it. Do you want it today or tomorrow?

answer-entrees-ask: Sure, {{ date }} in {{ hall }} for {{ meal }}'s entrees, there are {{ results | join(", ") }}. If you want to know more details such as starches, salads and soup, say "detail". You can also start another query now, or say "stop" to end this session.

answer-details: Here are the details about the {{ meal }} in {{ hall }} {{ date }}. For entrees, there are {{ results_entrees | join(", ") }}; For starches, there are {{ results_starches | join(", ") }}; For desserts, there are {{ results_desserts | join(", ") }}; For vegetables, there are {{ results_vegetables | join(", ") }}; For salads & salad bar, there are {{ results_salads | join(", ") }}.

error-not-found: I am sorry to tell you that there is no information about that yet. You can ask another one now, or you can say "stop" to end this session.

error-not-understand: I am sorry that I could not understand you. Could you say it again?

goodbye: Goodbye.
