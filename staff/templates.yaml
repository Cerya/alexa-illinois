welcome: |
  Welcome to the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign faculty/staff directory skill.
  For details on what information I can provide, say "help".
  How can I assist you today?

help: |
  You can search for information about Illinois faculty and staff by using their first, last, or middle names. 
  To build a query, I need one part of their name at a time so I know where to look.  
  For example, if you're looking for information on a Will Smith, you would start by saying "first name Will". 
  After I've got that name, you would then say "last name Smith". 
  Finally, say "start" to initiate the query.
  It's okay if you don't give me one or two of the names, I'll return all the matches. 
  You can try it out now.

confirm-clue: |
  Got it, {{ which_name }} {{ name }}. Do you know any additional parts of their name? Or you can say "start" to initiate the query.

answer-results: |
  There are {{ num_results }} results matching your query. 
  They are {% for result in results %} {{ result['role'] }} {{ result["firstname"] }} {% if "middlename" in result.keys() %} {{ result["middlename"] }} {% endif %} 
  {{ result["lastname"] }} from {{ result["departmentname"] }}, whose office is at "placeholder for office address", {% endfor %}. 
  You can build another query now, or say "stop" to end this session.

answer-manyresults: |
  There are {{ num_results }} results matching your query, which is too many to return. 
  Can you add any additional information? 
  You can also build another query now, or say "stop" to end this session.

answer-noresults: |
  I'm sorry, but I do not have anyone matching that query in my records. 
  You can build another query now, or say "stop" to end this session.

error-not-understand: |
  I'm sorry, but I couldn't understand that. Can you please say it again?

error-other: |
  I'm sorry, but I've hit an error. Please try again.

goodbye: Goodbye.
