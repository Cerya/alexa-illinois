help: |
  You can search for information about Illinois faculty and staff by using their first, last, or middle names. 
  To build a query, I need one part of their name at a time so I know where to look.  
  For example, if you're looking for information on a Will Smith, you would start by saying "first name Will". 
  After I've got that name, you would then say "last name Smith". 
  Finally, say "start" to initiate the query.
  What else can I assist you with?

confirm-clue: |
  Got it, {{ which_name }} {{ name }}. Do you know any additional parts of their name? Or you can say "start" to initiate the query.

answer-results: |
  There is {{ num_results }} results matching your query. 
  {% for result in results %}
    {{result['role']}} {{result["firstname"]}} {% if "middlename" in result.keys() %} {{result["middlename"]}} {% endif %} {{result["lastname"]}} from {{result["departmentname"]}}, 
    whose office is at 
    {% if result["firstname"] == "Robert" %}
      "226 Astronomy Building, MC-221 1002 West Green Street, Urbana".
      His email is, bigdog@illinois.e-d-u.
      His phone number is, 217-244-6099.
    {% else %}
      "226 Astronomy Building, MC-221 1002 West Green Street, Urbana".
      Phone number, 217-244-6099.
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
  You can build another query now, or say "stop" to end this session.

  There are {{num_results}} results matching your query, which is too many to return. 
  Can you add any additional information? 
  You can also build another query now, or say "stop" to end this session.

  I'm sorry, but I do not have anyone matching that query in my records. 
  You can build another query now, or say "stop" to end this session.
