  What else can I assist you with?

help: |
  To begin with, I can tell you the menus in all available dining halls.
  For example, you can ask "What's for breakfast today in P.A.R. dining hall?", "What's for lunch in Ikenberry dining hall tomorrow?,
  or simply "dinner in P.A.R. hall today".
  Or you can say "interactive" and I will ask you questions to help with your search.
  I can also provide more details about the selected meals if you say "details".
